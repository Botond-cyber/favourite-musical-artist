      <p class="aboutP">
        Dutch DJ/producer Maddix is known for his genre-breaking techno-rave
        sound, infused with big room and trance influences.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutP">
        Starting his new core sound in 2018, with the release of his legendary
        track <a href="">‘Ecstasy’</a> in 2019, he continuously refreshed the EDM landscape
        with hard-hitting techno kicks and an acid revival, organically evolving
        his sound even more towards techno and trance. Most importantly, Maddix
        brought the rave back to the club and festival crowds, and received
        support from techno artists such as Deborah de Luca, Amelie Lens, Ki/Ki,
        Umek, Eli Brown, John Summit, Hi-Lo, Lilly Palmer and many others.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutP">
        After Maddix' hit singles <a href="">‘Heute Nacht’</a> and <a href="">‘My Gasoline,’</a> and
        collaborations with Hardwell, Umek, KSHMR, Timmy Trumpet, and remixes
        for Tiësto and Armin van Buuren, his audience has grown into a truly
        global collective. This growth has led to appearances at major festivals
        such as Ultra Music Festival, EDC, Dreamstate, Parookaville, World Club
        Dome, Mysteryland, and headlining club shows around the world.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutP">
        In partnership with Revealed Recordings, Maddix’s brand-new record label
        Extatic (XTTC) was launched in 2023. Alongside achieving 500 million+
        streams, reaching 5 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and multiple
        #1 spots on Beatport and Spotify’s Editorial playlist, including DJMag
        top100 DJ list entry in 2023, we can say Maddix has created a movement
        that is changing the electronic dance music scene.
