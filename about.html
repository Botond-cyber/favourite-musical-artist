        Dutch DJ/producer Maddix is known for his genre-breaking techno-rave
        sound, infused with big room and trance influences.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutP">
        Starting his new core sound in 2018, with the release of his legendary
        track

        >
        in 2019, he continuously refreshed the EDM landscape with hard-hitting
        techno kicks and an acid revival, organically evolving his sound even
        more towards techno and trance. Most importantly, Maddix brought the
        rave back to the club and festival crowds, and received support from
        techno artists such as Deborah de Luca, Amelie Lens, Ki/Ki, Umek, Eli
        Brown, John Summit, Hi-Lo, Lilly Palmer and many others.

        and collaborations with Hardwell, Umek, KSHMR, Timmy Trumpet, and
        remixes for Tiësto and Armin van Buuren, his audience has grown into a
        truly global collective. This growth has led to appearances at major
        festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, EDC, Dreamstate, Parookaville,
        World Club Dome, Mysteryland, and headlining club shows around the
        world.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutP">
        In partnership with Revealed Recordings, Maddix’s brand-new record label
        Extatic (XTTC) was launched in 2023. Alongside achieving 500 million+
        streams, reaching 5 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and multiple
        #1 spots on Beatport and Spotify’s Editorial playlist, including DJMag
        top100 DJ list entry in 2023, we can say Maddix has created a movement
        that is changing the electronic dance music scene.
